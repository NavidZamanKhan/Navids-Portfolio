    - [ ] Contact section with form or contact details.

8. Responsiveness & Polish:
    - [ ] Ensure layout adapts to different screen sizes: desktop, tablet, mobile.
    - [ ] Add hover effects and animations for interactivity.
    - [ ] Test all navigation and links.

9. (Optional) Data Models:
    - [ ] Create models for projects, blog posts, etc., if loading from JSON or API.

10. Testing:
    - [ ] Test all widgets and screens for UI bugs.
    - [ ] Test responsiveness and interactivity.

Tip: Break each checkbox into smaller todos as you work. For each widget or screen, start with a basic layout, then add styling, then add interactivity.

Let me know if you want a sample file/folder structure or code snippets for any of these steps.
